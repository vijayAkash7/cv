        <p align="justify" font-size="20">The Himalayan mountain ecosystem is globally renowned for biological diversity. The Himalayan mountain system contributes to 13% of the world avian species. About 1313 avian species have been reported in the Indian subcontinent (Grimmett et al. 2011). This area has been recognised as an Endemic Bird Area (EBA 128) by BirdLife International (Stattersfield et al. 1998) due to rich avian diversity and regional endemism. Habitat alteration remains a major threat to mountain ecosystems around the world. The deformation of land and water due to development activities are well documented in the Indian Himalayan Region (Grumbine and Pandit 2013, Manel et al. 2000). Due to this, regular interval monitoring is required on avian fauna in this region. Some States of the Indian Himalayan Region are recognised for their rich diversity and vegetation cover. The Uttarakhand State in the Western Himalayan Region is one of them. The avian survey study was conducted in the Dehradun District of Uttarakhand (29°55' and 30°30' N Lat. and 77°35' and 78°24' E Long.). The present study area covered about 85.7% of Dehradun District (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). The survey area was categorised into water streams, forest and agriculture habitats at different elevation ranges i.e. 300-900 m, 900-1500 m and 1500-2100 m.

        <p align="justify">The hilly forest area of Dehradun is dominated by the Rhododendron arboreum, Quercus incana, Quercus dilatata and Cedrus deodara trees. The forest habitat ranges between 900 to 1500 m a.s.l. and is covered with moist Sal forest and dry Sal forest. In addition, Shorea robusta, Terminalia bellerica, Cedrela toona, Dalbergia sissoo and Butea monosperma tree species are also distributed in Dehradun (Champion and Seth 1968). However, the agriculture habitat is occupied with seasonal crops and most of the agriculture area is attached to the forest area.

          The temperature varies from 10°C in winter (December – February) to 38°C in summer months (April-July). The rainfall pattern in the study area is monsoon-dependent. Dehradun receives the rainfall from July to September and the maximum rainfall is recorded in July and August (Pandey et al. 1994).

      <td><p align="justify"><b>small irrigation tank in Vedanthangal village surrounded by rocky plains and low-ridged, denuded hillocks, this Site is an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) due to the presence of several species including the black-headed ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala). Vedanthangal is well known for nature tourism, which generates considerable revenue for the local communities. The Sanctuary also provides educational and research opportunities. The wetland also plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and groundwater recharge, which supports irrigation activities in the immediate vicinity. Although the Site has been a Bird Sanctuary since 1998 and a management plan is being implemented, housing and uncontrolled aquatic resource harvesting are some of the significant threats.These sanctuaries are famous for their breeding heronry including cormorants, egrets, grey heron, open-billed stork, darter, spoonbill, white lbnis, night herons, grebes, grey pelican etc. Many migratory birds like garganey teals, shovellers, pintails, stilts, sandpipers etc. Visit the sanctuary in winter</b></td></p>
